A basic platformer being made with [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/).
It doesn't have a name yet, because it has barely been started.
It will feature singleplayer levels, a level editor, and maybe multiplayer.

Create an [issue](https://github.com/ChicknTurtle/love2d-platformer/issues) for suggestions :)
