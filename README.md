## love2d-platformer

A basic platformer being made with [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/).\
It doesn't have a name yet because it is so early in development.\
It will feature singleplayer levels, a level editor, and maybe multiplayer.\
Includes a [web-packager.sh](https://github.com/ChicknTurtle/love2d-platformer/blob/main/web-packager.sh) file for deploying to the web for quick testing.

Create an [issue](https://github.com/ChicknTurtle/love2d-platformer/issues) for suggestions
